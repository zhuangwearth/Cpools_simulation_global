Global 0.5-degree distribution of steady-state carbon pools simulated

## Description of the Data and file structure

The dataset contains the simulated results used to plot Figs 6 and 7 in the manuscript "Representing Mineral Adsorption in a Microbial-Explicit Soil Carbon Model: Calibration Using Bare Fallow Observations and Global Implication".
The dataset contains three stacked TIF files of global 0.5-degree distribution of steady-state carbon pools simulated by three versions of MIMICS model (MIMICSa, MIMICSb, MIMICSc). Each TIF file has 7 layers representing 7 carbon pools (unit kg C m-2) at the depth of 1 m. Layer 1 is LITm (metabolic litter). Layer 2 (structural litter): LITs, Layer 3: MBr ( r-type microbial biomass), Layer 4: MBK (K-type microbial biomass). Layer 5: Cphs (physically-protected carbon). Layer 6: Cchm (chemically-recalcitrant carbon). Layer 7 is Cavl (available carbon). The dataset can be opened with Raster package in R.
